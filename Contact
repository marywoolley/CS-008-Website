  <p>I knew as a young child that I did not agree with any sort of violence. My family has owned guns, as many members of my family are cops, or
  were in the military. I was never comfortable around the weapons, knowing that they were designed for the purpose of injuring others.
  But it wasn't until the Aurora Shooting in 2012, with the Sandy Hook Shooting just a few short months after, that I realized 
  just how badly we needed stronger gun control. Where I lived in Virginia, there is a tragic suicide epidemic. I began to 
  realize that we didn't just need gun control to prevent homicides, we needed it to prevent suicides as well. Our Constitution
  is popularly described as a "living" document, since it was written so that it can be amended to fit our needs of the time. 
  I strongly believe that we need stricter gun laws for our country that has changed quite a bit from when our laws were written
  in 1788.</p>

  <p>I am from a family with very mixed feelings about gun control. I grew up listening to my father's family insist that it is a 
  basic human right to bare arms. They would become enraged when the news, reporting on some tragedy, brought up strengthening 
  gun control. I did not agree with them, but I did not form my own opinion until the shooting at Sandy Hook in 2012. I live 
  just over an hour from Sandy Hook, and had been there many times. Unfortunately it took striking a chord close to home to 
  make me realized the real devastation of gun violence. Today, I strongly advocate enforcing stricter gun control despite 
  our second amendment.</p>
