  <p>I from a family with very mixed feelings about gun control. I grew up listening to my father's family insist that it is a 
  basic human right to bare arms. They would become enraged when the news, reporting on some tragedy, brought up strengthening 
  gun control. I did not agree with them, but I did not form my own opionion until the shooting at Sandy Hook in 2012. I live 
  just over an hour from Sandy Hook, and had been there many times. Unfortunately it took striking a chord close to home to 
  make me realized the real devistation of gun violence. Today, I strongly advocate enforcing stricter gun control despite 
  our second amendment.</p>
