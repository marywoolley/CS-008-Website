  <h1>History</h2>
  <p>In the 1750s guns are becoming more common place. Pistols are produced more easily and are beginning to replace swords in day to day life and in duels.</p>
  
  <p>In 1791 the Second Amendment is ratified</p>
  <p>The precussion cap replaces flicklock ignition in 1807. These make it less likely for a gun to misfire and would work 
  in any weather.</p>
  <p>The precussion cap would not be used by the US military until 1833.</p>
  <pThe Industrial Age starts and in 1835 the Colt revolver is invented and mass produced. This is the first revolving, 
  multi-shot gun.</p>
  <p>Pin-fire cartridges become common place in 1840. They made it easy to check if the gun was loaded or not.</p>
  <p>In 1859 rim-fire cartridges come into use. They are cheap, and make guns more powerful. Soon after, in 1960, the 
  Spencer Repeating Rifle is shown to the government but is shot down until 1963, stating that it was a waste of ammunition. 
  In 1961 Breech guns are common, loading in the back of the gun as opposed to the muzzle.</p>
  <p>1862 is when the spring loaded, rapid-fire gun appears: the Gatling gun.</p>
  <p>The center-fire cartridge is invented in 1869, more reliable.</p>
  <p>In 1871 the first cartiridge revolver is made, a compact, quickly shooting gun.</p>
  <p>Double action revolvers are introduced in 1877. You no longer need to cock the gun before pulling the trigger</p>
  <p>The Lee Box magazine, best for rapid loading, is released in 1879.</p>
  <p>1892- the year of the first automatic handgun.
  
  
  <p>The automatic Winchester rifle is released in 1903.</p>
  <p>The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the Second Amendment protected the rights of citizens to own firearms not in 
  connection to any sort of militia.</p>
