    <p>On October first, at a country music festival in Las Vegas, shots rang out for fifteen minutes, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more. Natalia, a teenager looking forward to homecoming, was in the thick of it, separated from her friends and twin sister, terrified. Seconds later, a bullet ripped through her shoulder, knocking her to the floor. Still looking for her sister, her friends helped her to safety. But even in the medical tent they could not escape the terror. Next to her was a man missing multiple fingers and a boy from her school who had been shot in the stomach. He continually asked for help, but medics were in short supply and no one came.</p>
    <p>A man was lying on the ground with a wound in his neck died, and they left his body there on the ground and moved on. Natalia began to lose consciousness, but there were no ambulances left to take her to the hospital, so a man who made it to his car took her, running ever red light he hit. When they made it to the hospital it was already red with the blood of other victims of the shooting, crying out the the overworked nurses for help. During a stressful surgery, doctors learned that Natalia's lung had been punctured, and shrapnel had buried itself in her opposite shoulder. Had it hit just centimeters to the right, the bullet would have killed her. Later, her twin, Gianna, who had been shot in the leg, was reunited with her sister.</p>
    <p>Not everyone was as lucky as Natalia. Many were trapped between the gates and the bullets with no exit. Even crouching behind a vendor, there was no safe way to run. Shae, another student and daughter of an FBI agent, lead some friends out through a gate, dodging bursts of gun fire. She immediately called her mother, alerting the FBI of the crisis. She and her friend, Delaney, hid in the women's restroom. Meanwhile, Marie and Summer climbed over a fence in their formal wear, stepping over bodies to get there. They watched as victims were loaded into the beds of pickup trucks and rushed to the hospital. Although they were told not to look, Marie couldn't take her eyes off the scene: a stricken woman covered in blood was rushed by. Her husband had been shot in front of her eyes. The friends sat behind a truck doing the only thing they could: listen to the shots get closer.</p>
    <p>The shooter, Stephen Paddock, who was apprehended and taken to the hospital, killed himself, leaving over fifty dead, hundreds wounded, and hundreds more traumatized.</p>
    <p>After the shooting, Natalia and her twin returned to school after recovering in the hospital. Shae, not wanting to be alone at home, returned to school the next day. However, Marie did not return until days later, and even then had to leave. She ran at the sound of a motorcycle approaching, and when she heard a door slam she started sobbing. The students who experienced the shooting are constantly told that they are strong, be ever after the danger has passed they do not feel strong. They are terrified.</p>

    <p>Missy Gross survived the Las Vegas shooting. But now, her surviver's guilt haunts her, remembering looking out into the crowd as the shots rang out as she ran to save herself. Gross recalls she saw, "veterans or anyone who had some sort of training, standing up and making themselves targets, trying to protect us" (Schoellkopf). She reflects on the events at the festival and says that she does not plan on attending one again, and even canceled her bachelorette party that was to take place in Vegas. She remembers the feeling of safety she used to have at festivals and knows she will never feel that again.</p>
    <p>Gross donated blood in an attempt to make a small difference, anything she could to help, but cannot help wondering why she survived and so many others did not. She says, "It's very difficult for me to have these memories and these images of people, this woman on the ground with her leg bleeding and this man who had been shot in the head, watching these faces on people who are scarred into my brain and not knowing how to help"(Schoellkopf). She continually relives her experiences, running through the images of the butchery she saw, not sleeping and dreaming of gunfire when she does. Gross is trying to move forward with her life, but is still waiting to be able to feel safe in her own home again.</p>

    <h1><a href='https://www.bradycampaign.org/gun-violence/victim-stories/markie-3'>A Mother's Story</a></h1>
    <p>One day, having left her little boy, Markie, with her trusted babysitter, one mother's life changed forever. Her babysitter not only had an eleven-year-old, but had a gun in an unlocked closet. No one meant to hurt anyone else, nor did the babysitter mean any harm by leaving the closet unlocked, but that day, tragedy struck. Her child found that gun and pulled it out, as curious as any other child would be. When the toddler entered the room the gun went off, killing him.</p>
    <p>Markie was three years old. He will never graduate high school, hold hands with the love of his life, or grow up to have a son of his own, and his mother will never hold him again. Because of a mistake that could have been easily avoided, we have lost yet another child.</p>
    <h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/2013/04/13/opinion/paugh-guns-suicide-irpt/index.html'>A Premature Death</a></h1>
    <p>In a family where guns were common and gun violence was ignored, they were finally forced to wonder: should we lay down our arms? A woman who has experienced too much loss tells the story of how guns have hurt her and her family. When she was young, her father, having lost hope of finding work and disappointed in himself, ended his own life, leaving behind five children. She did not keep guns in the house as she raised her three sons, worried about accidents, but never could have predicted what would happen later in life. Two of her sons, including her youngest, purchased themselves handguns. Peter, the youngest at twenty-five, shot himself ten months later. As an organ donor he saved multiple lives, but there was only one life that his mother wanted back.</p>
    <p>She is now an advocate against gun use. She says that most suicides are preformed by gun, and very few survive. She goes on to point out that most people who survive their suicide attempts go on to receive help, and do not make a second attempt. If we remove guns from the equation, thousands of lives could be saved.</p>
    <p>If you are having feelings of hopelessness or are having suicidal thoughts or actions please reach out to friends, family, or a councillor. Call to get help immediately on the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at <a href="tel:18002738255">1-800-273-8255</a>.</p>
