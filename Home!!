  <p>With just a little more gun control, we could save our country hundreds of deaths per year. If gun owners were simply required to keep their firearms locked away and unloaded while they are not being used the country could be saved hundreds of tragedies yearly. Additionally, assault weapons are highly dangerous. Banning them from civilian use could prevent countless deaths.</p>
  <p>Everyday thousands of lives are affected by guns. Children are accidentally killed by parents, 
        troubled teenagers get ahold of family firearms and take their own lives, and men and women with hate in their hearts 
        walk into movie theaters and massacre people they have never met. Hundred are left mentally and physically scarred from 
        these horrific events, drowning in medical bills they cannot pay with terrifying memories they cannot forget. So many 
        support gun use and ignore the consequences until they themselves have to face them. Instead of waiting for tragedy to 
        strike, be proactive. If you insist on owning a gun, keep it hidden and locked away from you children and family members. 
        Do not leave the gun or gun loaded and before purchasing yourself a firearm, invest in some lessons so you know how to safely fire and store your weapon.</p>

  <p class="quote"><img alt="" src="images/elizabeth-warren.jpg" class="roundedCornersSmall midSizeRight" title='Elizabeth Warren'/>“We lose eight children and teenagers to gun violence every day. If a mysterious virus suddenly started killing eight of our children every day, America would mobilize teams of doctors and public health officials. We would move heaven and earth until we found a way to protect our children. But not with gun violence.”</p>
