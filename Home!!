  <p class="quote">“We lose eight children and teenagers to gun violence every day. If a mysterious virus suddenly started killing eight of our children every day, America would mobilize teams of doctors and public health officials. We would move heaven and earth until we found a way to protect our children. But not with gun violence.”</p>
  <p>-Elizabeth Warren</p>
  <p>"The regularity of mass killings breeds familiarity. The rhythms of grief and outrage that accompany them become—for 
  those not directly affected by tragedy—ritualised and then blend into the background noise. That normalisation makes it 
  ever less likely that America's political system will groan into action to take steps to reduce their frequency or 
  deadliness."</p>
