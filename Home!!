  <p>“We lose eight children and teenagers to gun violence every day. If a mysterious virus suddenly started killing eight of our children every day, America would mobilize teams of doctors and public health officials. We would move heaven and earth until we found a way to protect our children. But not with gun violence.”</p>
  <p>-Elizabeth Warren</p>
  <h1>Amendment II:</h1>
  <p><blockquote>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.</blockquote></p>
  <p>The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the Second Amendment protected the rights of citizens to own firearms not in connection to any sort of militia.</p>
